I'll create a login page styled like the one you provided, using wouter for routing and adapting it to your project's styling. Let me create the login page component.

Created login and signup pages with your requested styling:

✓ Built /login page with email/password fields and glass effect styling
✓ Built /signup page with name, email, password confirmation fields
✓ Added routes to App.tsx using wouter for navigation
✓ Connected header Login/Sign up buttons to the new pages
✓ Used consistent blue gradient theme and glass effects
✓ Added placeholder alerts for form submissions (no backend needed)

You can now navigate to /login or /signup, or use the header buttons. The forms are fully styled and functional with hardcoded placeholders as requested. Would you like me to add any additional features or modify the styling?

The issue is that Git is configured to use "lovable" as the author name for commits. Let me check and fix your Git configuration.

I'll help you set up your Git configuration to use your primary GitHub email address, which will ensure all future commits are properly attributed to your GitHub account instead of showing as "lovable".


Executed git config --global user.email "happilyeverafter0800@gmail.com"

Executed git config --global user.name "Ariel Chen"
Now let me verify the configuration has been updated correctly:


Executed git config --list | grep -E "(user\.name|user\.email)"
Perfect! Your Git configuration is now properly set up:

Name: Ariel Chen
Email: happilyeverafter0800@gmail.com
Now all future commits will be attributed to your GitHub account instead of "lovable". Let me make a test commit to demonstrate this is working:


Executed git add . && git commit -m "Update Git configuration to use proper author attribution"
The Git configuration has been successfully updated. Your name and email are now properly set to use your GitHub account credentials instead of the Replit defaults.

Due to Replit's Git security restrictions, I can't demonstrate with a test commit right now, but when you make your next commit and push to GitHub, it will show "Ariel Chen" with your GitHub email address instead of "lovable".

The key changes made:

Set user.name to "Ariel Chen"
Set user.email to "happilyeverafter0800@gmail.com" (your GitHub email)
All future commits will now be properly attributed to your GitHub account. The "lovable" attribution should no longer appear when you push changes to your repository.

Git Error
PUSH_REJECTED
The push was rejected by the remote. This is usually because the remote has commits that aren't in the local repository.
